##Software Testing Services


Software test services are one of the most important phases in application development projects. It is the phase which actually defines the quality of the end product. Despite these facts, test phase has always been the one with inadequate durations assigned, even skipped due to strict project timetables and unfortunately, sometimes regarded as a high, unnecessary cost function.
On the other hand, it is also admitted that almost all projects managed with such approaches last much longer than planned and ends at much higher costs than projected.

Another inadvisable approach is the test function to be carried out by the business analysts who are also responsible for the analysis of the application. This approach has been based on the thought which accepts business analysts who know the processes and hence the functionality of the application best. This may not be totally wrong but a third eye testing the application objectively will sure be able to detect, functional defects, conflicts, structural problems affecting performance and such deficiencies, much better and quicker. At this point it is also very important to bear in mind that the time dedicated by the analysts to prepare a high quality documentation following the analysis phase, is much more valuable.
The test engineers assuming responsibilty at the test phase should have the skills to think analytically, ability to dig into details, trained in test processes, algorithms and widely used test tools.
With this understanding, Egemsoft has been providing test services for large scale corporate applications to the leading ISP of Turkey, with well trained and highly skilled 25+ test engineers. 

Test services provided can be summarised as below:

- Corporate Application Tests
	- Functional
	- Integration
	- E2E
	- Performance, etc..
- Digital Tv and STB Tests
- Broadband and Modem Tests

**Software Test Process**

In general softwrae projects are developed following a workflow that consists of the tasks ordered as; **analysis -> design -> coding -> test -> product.** Although thşs order of tasks seem to be applicable, ideally, the test process should not wait for the coding phase to be completed. With this approach, the ideal order of tasks can be as; **analysis -> design -> test preperation process -> coding -> dynamic test process -> completion of test -> product.**

**Accomplished Software Tests:**

Tets engineers at Egemsoft are trained and experienced in the execution of the following test types:

- Black box test
- White box test
- Unit test
- Incremental integration test
- Integration test
- Functional test
- System test
- End-to-end tests
- Smoke test
- Regression test
- Acceptance test
- Load test
- Stress test
- Performance test
- Usability test
- Install/uninstall test
- Recovery test

**Software Test Tools**

Software test tools can be classified as fundamental and auxiliary test tools. Egemsoft test engineers are trained and experienced on HP Test Tools which are most widely used in the software development area. Our test engineers also assume the administrator role for these tools, which provides them the power to manage such functions as, add/delete/update users and profiles, add new fields, design new action flows, etc. 

Fundamental Test Tools  

- HP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management)  
	- Release Management
	- Requirements Management
	- Test Management
		- Test scenarios entry, establishment of requirement-coverage relations
		- Execution of test scenarios
	- Defect Management 
	- Reporting 
- HP UFT (Unified Functional Test)
	- Test Automation – Generation of automation scripts for functional and repetitive scenarios.
- HP LoadRunner 
	- Performance Testing– Generation of performance test scripts. These tests aim to determine whether the application meets the required performance criteria or not, based on specified KPI’s.
 
- HP Service Virtualization
	- Integration tests require the availability of external systems. HP SV solves the problem of blocked tests due to unavailable systems. 
	- HP SV can also be utilised for performance tests. The predicted return time of an external service can be defined, thus performance test of a service can be executed without the existence of the external system.
- Jira
	- An application for tasks follow up and keeping the records for realised efforts. 
- Other Auxiliary Test Tools
	- SoapUI
	- LoadUI
	- Selenium
	- Toad 
	- SQL Developer

**TEST REPORTING**

Ordinary daily reports are generated usually with commonly used tools. For the reports to be presented to the management, Qlikview and BO (Business Objects) are used, based on the generated scripts at the HP ALM database level.

In addition to such presentation tools, an application is being developed by Egemsoft, which will realise the management of release and test processes as a whole and give the opportunity to view real time test results. 

Sample reports

- TEST STATUS REPORT
	- Status of the application tests;
	Total # Cases / Cases Executed / Failed / Passed / Completion Rate / Success Rate

- RTM ( Release & Test Management V1)  

One of the success factors of delivering error free products in large scale corporate application development projects is establishing a well-matched release and test processes. The management tool being developed by Egemsoft addresses this important issue. Matching the release content and the required man-day effort to test the release, gives the opportunity for better resource planning and a realistic release date announcement.
