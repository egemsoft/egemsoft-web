##Modem Defects Detection Platform

Internet service providers are obliged to solve problems their clients face, whether it is a defect of a modem, a line failure or fault of subscriber, faster than their competitors, in order to maintain customer satisfaction and reduce churn. Modem Defect Detection Platform, developed by Egemsoft, offers two main applications that address these problems. 

**APPLICATION FOR TECHNICAL SERVICE CENTERS:**

Each month, 0.1%  of  all modems in the field are returned to service providers with the claim that the modem is defective. Technical centers receive these modems and without any detailed testing, these modems are shipped to manufactures for refurbisment. Detailed testing results show that at least  80% of these modems are nondefective. Defect detection platform running automatized tests on modems prevents time and costs being wasted  at the technical centers in refurbishment process. Immediate defect detection at warehouses is another option, which increases end-user satisfaction.
Modem Defect Detection Platform offers a client application for the technical service centers, operating on either a Kiosk or on an All-in-one PC depending upon request. It gives the opportunity to run automated and reliable tests. Configuration problems are solved and firmware updates are done automatically. These systems are controlled and managed by a server application, running at the Main Office.  

**Features of Client Application:**

- Automated testing
- User behavior simulation in the user web interface.
- Parallel testing of up to 4 modems. 
- Automatic updates  of  the client software
- Automatic installation of scripts required for testing of modems with new firmware and model. 
- Log recording and reporting to the server and printing out the results.

**Features of Server Application:**

- Client management and installation of updates.
